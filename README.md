Hello I am CadenCodes. I am currently a student coding on the side. I helped to found a Coding Interest Group at my school.



How to use the software:
Currently only works in Command Terminal (sorry but I haven't mastered visual python modules yet)
Uses Newton's Universal Gravitation to calculate the force of gravity between two objects.
Supports scientific notation in the form of e+ or e- the power
Useful for basic scientific exploration

Note: for the software to yield correct results, inputs must be in the units specified in the question.

Thank you for supporting my software, and I hope to see ya soon!
